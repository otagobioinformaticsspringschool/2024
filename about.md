# About

Bioinformatics Spring School 2020 is a week long training event for researchers, supported by Genomics Aotearoa and the New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI).

We will combine talks from researchers and hands on computational workshops (influenced by The Carpentries), covering example workflows of DNA variant calling, genotyping by sequencing (GBS), RNAseq analysis, and environmental DNA (eDNA).

This event is organised by Murray Cadzow, Ngoni Faya and Ludovic Dutoit.
