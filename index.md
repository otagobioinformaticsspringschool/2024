## About

Hosted at the University of Otago, the Bioinformatics Spring School 2024 is a week long training event for researchers, supported by [Genomics Aotearoa](https://www.genomics-aotearoa.org.nz) and the [New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI)](https://www.nesi.org.nz). This event is primarily targeted at researchers and students based in Aotearoa New Zealand. International applications will be considered but will need to be able to attend in-person.

We will combine talks from researchers and hands on computational workshops (influenced by [The Carpentries](https://www.carpentries.org)), covering example workflows using short and long read DNA sequencing technologies for variant calling and genome assembly.

This event is organised by:

### When and where?

- 9:30 - 16:30, 18-22 November 2024
- University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand

**This is an in-person event.**

<!-- | Day       | Topic                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------- |
| Monday    | Introduction NeSI / Bash      |
| Tuesday   | Genomic variant calling       |
| Wednesday | Workflows and Reproducibility |
| Thursday  | Genome Assembly               |
| Friday    | Nanopore                      | -->

### Cost?

This event itself will only cost your time (there isn't a $ charge) and lunches will be provided. Attendees will need to fund all other travel related expenses.

### Is this for me?

This event is designed to give researchers (including students - 4th year and above) the opportunity to learn about and practice some bioinformatic skills. We'll be covering bioinformatic workflows such as:

- DNA variant calling from next generation sequence data
- Genome Assembly
- RNAseq Analysis
- eDNA Analysis

along with computational topics such as:

- Introduction to the Unix commandline (Bash)
- Introduction to working in a high performance computing environment (provided by NeSI)

This week long event is designed to be an immersive experience so **we ask that you commit to the entire week.** We have chosen to interweave the computational topics throughout the week so that we can build on them throughout the entire week, so this ensures participants have the key knowledge at the right time.

### Expressions of Interest

Expressions of interest applications are now open and will close midnight, Friday 29th September 2024.

**Please register your interest in attending by filling out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmdsfoGlPyGgW4R1_EGomPlm41G4OJRjvKWnK6i3eZMYThHA/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

Applications close midnight Sunday 29th September 2024 anywhere on earth. Applicants will be notified of their outcome the week following the close of applications.
